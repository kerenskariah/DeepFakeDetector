# Deepfake Detection Tool

This tool is a simple web-based application for detecting deepfakes by comparing frames from "real" and "fake" videos. It extracts frames from each video, compares the frames using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and displays the results. 

Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for an interactive user experience.

## Features
- Upload real and fake videos for comparison.
- Extract frames and calculate MSE and SSIM values.
- Visualize frames side-by-side for easy comparison.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
